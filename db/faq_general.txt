Q: What is Mediation?
A: Mediation is a way to end disagreements by bringing in a person who is not involved in the situation. This person, who is called a Mediator, will listen to both sides of the story. Then, using this information, the Mediator will try to help each person better understand the other. The Mediator is there to help guide the conversation forward and help work towards an agreement. However, the Mediator will not force anyone to agree to anything. It is ultimately up to you and the person who you are in disagreement with to decide what you will or will not agree to. The Mediator is simply there to help you and the other person work through the issues you are facing.

Q: Do I have to Mediate?
A: Mediation is a voluntary process. This means that you, the other person, or the Mediator can end the mediation at any time. You are not forced to mediate. Instead, all who are involved in the dispute must agree to participate in mediation for it to be used. Mediation is highly recommended and encouraged as it has proven to help people understand the person they are in disagreement with and can often fix the problem.

Q: Is the Mediator on my side?
A: Mediators are neutral, third parties. This means that they do not take sides in a disagreement. Instead, they try to help both people better understand one another. The Mediator’s goal is to help each person communicate, understand, problem-solve, and eventually reach an agreement that both people can accept to end the dispute. 

Q: Can the Mediator give legal advice?
A: No, the Mediator is **NOT** your attorney and will **NOT** give you any legal advice. The Mediator may be able to point you in the direction of additional resources for more information.

Q: Who will decide if I am right?
A: Mediation is not about deciding who is “right” or “wrong” in a dispute. The Mediator is not a judge and will not decide anything to end the argument. Instead, it is up to the landlord and tenant to determine any outcomes.  If both reach an agreement, they will formally sign a mediation agreement that explains what each person is agreeing to. Once signed, the landlord and tenant must follow through and actually do what they committed to. 

Q: What happens if I sign a mediation agreement and then break it by not doing what I have agreed to?
A: A mediation agreement is a contract. This means that it can be legally enforced by the courts and breaking your commitment could lead to you paying additional money or being forced to take an action, such as being evicted. The mediation agreement signed may describe what will happen if you do not follow through on your commitments.
